Welcome to the Fall 2023 offering of CSE 6243!



Advanced machine learning topics including graphical models, optimization, generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.
These topics will be covered in **Four Modules**:
<ul>
    <li>
    **Module I: Background Knowledge** 
    - Convex Optimization: Convex function, duality, stochastic gradient descent
    - PGM: directed/undirected graphical models
    - Sampling: MH, Gibbs, HMC
    </li>
    
    <li>
    **Module II: Generative Model**
    - VAE, Autoregressive Model, GAN, EBM (CD, Score Matching), Diffusion Models
    </li>
    
    <li>
    **Module III: Differentiable Programming**
    - Differentiable Bilevel Optimization, Differentiable Sampler, Differentiable Algorithm (Planning). 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    **Module IV: Reinforcement Learning**
    - MDP, Dynamic Programming, Policy-gradient, LP-based algorithm 
    - (Offline RL, Exploration)
    </li>
</ul>
