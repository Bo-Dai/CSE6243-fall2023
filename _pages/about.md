Welcome to the Fall 2023 offering of CSE 6243!

**Prerequisite:** Graduate level Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics, Numerical Linear Algebra

This class is best for you if you have machine learning at the **CORE** of your studies/research, and want to understand the fundamentals.

***

Advanced Machine Learning is a graduate level course introducing the modern machine learning techniques, including graphical models, optimization, generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.
These topics will be covered in **Four Modules**:

- **Module I: Background Knowledge** 
  - Convex Optimization: Convex function, duality, stochastic gradient descent
  - PGM: directed/undirected graphical models
  - Sampling: MH, Gibbs, HMC

- **Module II: Generative Model**
  - VAE, Autoregressive Model, GAN, EBM (CD, Score Matching), Diffusion Models

- **Module III: Differentiable Programming**
  - Differentiable Bilevel Optimization, Differentiable Sampler, Differentiable Algorithm (Planning). 

- **Module IV: Reinforcement Learning**
  - MDP, Dynamic Programming, Policy-gradient, LP-based algorithm 
  - (Offline RL, Exploration)

<ins>**The course will be very math and theory heavy.**</ins> The students are expected to develop the skill of design computationally and statistically efficient machine learning algorithms for practical problems.
