### Grading

The class requirements include [TOFILL].
This is a Graduate level course, and by the end of this class you should have a good understanding of the basic methodologies in [TOFILL].
The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Participation (10%)
- Homework Assignments (40%)
- Final Project (50%)


***

### Participation

We appreciate everyone being actively involved in the class!
There are several ways of earning participation credit, which will be capped at 4%:
- **Piazza participation:** The top ~20 contributors to Piazza will get 3.5%; others will get credit in proportion to the participation of the ~20th person. (To prevent abuse of the system, not all contributions are counted and instructors hold the right to determine to count contributions as positive or negative.)
- **Completing mid-semester evaluation:** Around the middle of the semester, we will send out a survey to help us understand how the course is going, and how we can improve. Completing it is worth 0.5%.


### Homework Assignments

There will be 4 homework assignments over the course of the semester.
These assignments may contain material that has been covered by published papers and webpages.
It is a graduate class and we expect students to solve the problems themselves rather than search for answers.

**The students are required to typeset homework solutions using $$\LaTeX$$ and the provided template.**

#### Collaboration Policy

**Homework assignments must be done individually:** each student must hand in their own answers.
However, it is acceptable to collaborate when figuring out answers and to help each other solve the problems.
We will be assuming that, as participants in a graduate course, you will be taking the responsibility to make sure you personally understand the solution arising from such collaboration.
You also must indicate on each homework with whom you have collaborated.

#### Late Policy

You will be allowed **6 total homework late days** without penalty for the entire semester.
You may be late by up to 6 days on any homework assignment.
Once those days are used, you will be penalized according to the following policy:

- Homework is worth full credit at the due time on the due date.
- The allowed late days are counted by day (i.e., each new late day starts at 12:00 am ET).
- Once the allowed late days are exceeded, the penalty is 50% per late day conted by hour (i.e., 2.0833% per hour).
- The homework is worth zero credit 48 hours after exceeding the late day limit.

You must turn in at least 3 of the 4 assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.
Please upload your late submissions to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/36025){:target="\_blank"}.

#### Regrade Policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework, please submit a regrading request on Gradescope and we will consider your request.
Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your grade to go either up or down.

***

### Final Project

The class project will be carried out in groups of 3 or 4 people, and has four main parts: a proposal, a midway report, a final report, and a poster/oral presentation.
The project is an integral part of this class, and is designed to be as similar as possible to researching and writing a conference-style paper.

Please see the [project page](https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/project/) for more information about the final project.

***

### Auditing

To satisfy the auditing requirement, you must do *one* of the following:

1. **Submit three homeworks** and receive at least 75% of the points on each one.
2. **Do a class project** which must address a topic related to machine learning and must be something that you have started while taking this class (i.e. it can't be your previous work).
You will need to submit a project proposal with everyone else, and present the project with everyone.
However, you don't need to submit a milestone or final paper.
You must get at least 80% on the final presentation part of the project.

*If you plan to audit the class, please notify instructors that you are auditing and specify which requirement you plan to fulfill.*
